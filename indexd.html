		<h1>Quick Bio</h1>
		<br>
		<b>Nikki Zeeb Fowler</b> - Professional singer for 15 years.  Regarded in mid-Michigan as one of the finest female vocalist.  Her range is simply tremendous.  She is able to capture the feel of Patsy Cline, to Pat Benatar, to Celine Dion; and seems to know the words to EVERY SONG!
		<br><br>
		<b>Ricky Nalett</b> - Professional pianist / keybordist / vocalist for over thirty years. His experience ranges from traveling the country in one of mid-Michigan's premire rock bands, to having a show on Mackinac Island with his  Singing Wait Staff, to a pianist, and engineer /producer in his recording studio, L.A. Productions.  Ricky knows every song in the world....except three!
		<br><br>
		<b>Bob Giunta</b> -  Professional guitarist / vocalist for over twenty five years.  With his high energy style and his guitar proficiency, he provides the spark to keep the party going! Bob happens to know the three songs Ricky doesn't!! 
		<br><br>
		<b>Donny Brown</b> - Professional drummer / vocalist for over twenty five years.  Donny's  high energy and enthusiasm is infectious!  With his clear and strong vocals, he is one of Lansing's premiere talents!
		<br><br>
		And our "fifth member"* of Life Support...
		<br><br>
		<b>Bronnie Brown</b> - Our premier saxophonist!  From Brownie's incredible jazz chops to his spin on rock classics are simply amazing!  (*Bronnie appears with Life Support only with prior booking.)
