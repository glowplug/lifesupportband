				Is not a "jam band".  We are the same members at every performance.  Many bands hire who's available to come play with them, so you might get  a good band or...well...who knows.
				<br><br>
				<h1>Affordable</h1>  What you say?  Well, when you are done decorating the hall and eating the cake, the one thing that people will always comment on down the road will be about the entertainment.  This is why we feel we are your best wedding reception dollar and that in comparison, we are affordable. 
				<br><br>
				<h1>Entertainment Options</h1>Please ask us.  We can provide music for your ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, etc. We can accommodate most musical situations with either a pianist, vocalist, and/or  a jazz trio and more.
