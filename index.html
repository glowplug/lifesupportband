		<h1>Life Support Band</h1>
		Has been a performing unit for thirteen years, with over 120 years of combined performing experience. The key members of the band consist of Nikki Fowler on lead vocals, Ricky Nalett on keyboards and vocals,  Bob Giunta on guitar and vocals, and Donny Brown drums and vocals. And on special request, our fifth member of Life Support, Bronnie Brown.
		<br><br>
		Was one of the premiere bands at "The Beer Barrel" in Put-In-Bay for several years and has been one of the number one requested bands on Mackinac Island for performing wedding receptions.
		<br><br>
		Is much more than your typical "bar band".  Life Support has a unique ability to perform anything from jazz standards, classic rock, to songs from recent artist.  
		<br><br>
		Has been around for twelve years and we are not going anywhere, so rest assured that when you book us, we will be there!
		<br><br>
		Specializes in corporate parties and wedding receptions and we perform from Mackinac Island to Put-In-Bay.
		<br><br>
		Is not a "jam band".  We are the same members at every performance.  Many bands hire who's available to come play with them, so you might get  a good band or...well...who knows.
